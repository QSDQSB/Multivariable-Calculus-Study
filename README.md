# Multivariable-Calculus-Study
- This project shares QSD's Multivariable Calculus Study files.
- The project follows University of Oxford's Prelims Multivariable Calculus courses, with lecture notes and problem sheets available here: https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/43944.
- The project majorly includes re-organising lecture notes to separate markdown files plus merging some additional materials from other sources.
- The project works fine with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
