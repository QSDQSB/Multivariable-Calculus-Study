# Multivariable-Calculus-Study
- This project shares QSD's Multivariable Calculus Study files.
- The project follows University of Oxford's Prelims Multivariable Calculus courses, with lecture notes and problem sheets available here: https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/43944.
- The project majorly includes re-organising lecture notes to separate markdown files plus merging some additional materials from other sources.
- The project works fine with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Course Synopsis

- Recap on surface and line integrals. Flux integrals including solid angle. Work integrals and conservative fields.
- Scalar and vector fields. Vector differential operators: divergence and curl; physical interpretation. Calculation. Identities.
- Divergence theorem. Example. Consequences: Green's 1st and second theorems.
- Uniqueness of solutions of Poisson's equation. Derivation of heat equation. Divergence theorem in plane. Informal proof for plane.
