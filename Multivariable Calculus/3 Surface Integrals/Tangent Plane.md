## Tangent Plane
#MVC 
### Definition
Let $\mathbf{r}: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a smooth parameterized [[surface]] and let $\mathbf{p}$ be a point on the surface. The plane containing $\mathbf{p}$ and which is parallel to the vectors
$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u}(\mathbf{p}) \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}(\mathbf{p})
$$
$\partial \mathbf{r} / \partial u$ and $\partial \mathbf{r} / \partial v$ is called the tangent plane to $\mathbf{r}(U)$ at $\mathbf{p}$. Because these vectors are independent the tangent plane is well-defined, and can also be shown to be independent of the choice of parameterization.
