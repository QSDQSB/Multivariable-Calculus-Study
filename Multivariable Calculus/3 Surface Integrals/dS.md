## Notation: dS
### Definition: Infinitesimal Part
We will often write
$$
\mathrm{d} S=\left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \wedge \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\right| \mathrm{d} u \mathrm{~d} v
$$
to denote an infinitesimal part of [[surface area]]. We will also write
$$
\mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \wedge \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \mathrm{~d} u \mathrm{~d} v
$$
This is also commonly written as $\mathbf{n} \mathrm{d} S$ where $\mathbf{n}$ is the choice of [unit normal](Surface#Definition%2035) in the direction of $\partial \mathbf{r} / \partial u \wedge \partial \mathbf{r} / \partial v$.
### Definition: $\mathrm{d}\bf S$
>When the surface $\Sigma$ encloses a $3 D$ region such as the surface of the unit sphere, the standard convention is that $\color{yellow}\mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}=\mathbf{n} \mathrm{d} S$ has the normal, $n$ pointing **outwards** from the body.
